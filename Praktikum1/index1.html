    <b>We’ll begin with a box, and the plural is boxes,<br>
    But the plural of ox becomes oxen, not oxes.<br>
    One fowl is a goose, but two are called geese,<br>
    Yet the plural of moose should never be meese.<br>
    You may find a lone mouse or a nest full of mice,<br>
    Yet the plural of house is houses, not hice.</b></p></font>

        Why shouldn’t the plural of pan be called pen?<br>
        <u>If</u> I speak of my foot and show you my feet,<br>
        And I give you a boot, would a pair be called beet?<br>
        <u>If</u> one is a tooth and a whole set are teeth,<br>
        Why shouldn’t the plural of booth be called beeth?</b></p></font>

        Then one may be that, and three would be those,<br>
        Yet hat in the plural would never be hose,<br>
        And the plural of cat is cats, not cose.<br>
        We speak of a brother and also of brethren,<br>
        But though we say mother, we never say methren.<br>
        Then the masculine pronouns are he, his and him,<br>
        <s>But imagine the feminine: she, shis and shim!</s>
